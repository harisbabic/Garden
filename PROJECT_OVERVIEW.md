# Grow Tracking Web App

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive grow tracking web application designed for gardening enthusiasts. It enables users to monitor and manage their gardens efficiently, providing features for tracking planting schedules, growth stages, maintenance activities, and more.

## Key Features
- User Management with Authentication
- Plant Management (CRUD operations)
- Tracking and Scheduling (planting, harvesting, watering, feeding)
- Weather API Integration
- Notifications for Reminders and Alerts
- Dashboard for Garden Status Overview
- Analytics for Garden Productivity

## Project Structure
This project follows a modular architecture for both the server and client sides. The structure is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easily extendable.

## Development Process
We follow a standardized handoff process to maintain continuity across development sessions. Please refer to DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md for more details on our development process and PROJECT_STATUS.md for the current project status.

## Getting Started
(Include instructions for setting up the development environment, installing dependencies, and running the application locally.)

## Contributing
(Include guidelines for contributing to the project, if applicable.)

## License
(Include license information.)






Finally, let's create the initial PROJECT_STATUS.md:


# Project Status

## Project Status Summary
The project is in its initial setup phase. We have established the basic project structure, including the modular architecture for both server and client sides.

## Current Focus
- Setting up the project structure
- Implementing the module loader system
- Creating initial documentation (README.md, DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md)

## Recent Changes
- Created basic project structure with modular architecture
- Implemented module loader for both server and client
- Established standardized handoff process
- Created initial project documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement the core module with basic functionality
2. Set up the database and ORM
3. Implement the user management module
4. Set up authentication system
5. Begin work on the plant management module

## Open Questions or Challenges
- Decide on the specific ORM to use for database interactions
- Determine the best approach for handling real-time updates (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events)
- Explore options for integrating with weather APIs




Now that we have implemented the standardized handoff process and created the necessary documentation, we can move forward with the project. The modular structure you proposed is excellent and provides a solid foundation for a robust and scalable application.

To enhance the frontend flexibility and customization, we could consider the following additions:

1. Implement a plugin system for the frontend, allowing for easy addition of new features or customization of existing ones.
2. Use a state management library like Redux or MobX for more complex state management needs.
3. Implement a theming system to allow for easy customization of the application's look and feel.

For the next steps, I suggest we focus on implementing the core module with basic functionality. This would include setting up the database, implementing the ORM, and creating the basic CRUD operations for the plant management system.

Shall we proceed with implementing the core module? If so, we can start by setting up the database and ORM, and then move on to creating the basic plant management functionality.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
