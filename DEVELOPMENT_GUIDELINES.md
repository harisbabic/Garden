Now, let's create the DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md:


# Development Guidelines

## Code Structure
This project follows a modular architecture. Each module should be self-contained with its own routes, components, and business logic.

### Directory Structure
```
project-root/
├── server/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── modules/
│   │   │   ├── core/
│   │   │   ├── user-management/
│   │   │   ├── authentication/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── module-loader.js
├── client/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── modules/
│   │   │   ├── core/
│   │   │   ├── user-management/
│   │   │   ├── authentication/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── module-loader.js
└── module-config.json
```

## Module Development
1. Create a new directory for your module under `server/src/modules/` and/or `client/src/modules/`.
2. Implement the module's functionality.
3. Update `module-config.json` to include your new module.

## Coding Standards
(Include specific coding standards, style guides, and best practices for the project.)

## Testing
(Include guidelines for writing and running tests.)

## Thread Handoff Process
To maintain continuity across development sessions and conversation threads, we use a standardized handoff process:

1. At the end of each significant development session or conversation thread, update the PROJECT_STATUS.md file with the latest handoff summary.
2. The handoff summary should include:
   - Project Status Summary
   - Current Focus
   - Recent Changes
   - Next Steps
   - Open Questions or Challenges
3. At the beginning of each new development session or conversation thread, refer to the PROJECT_STATUS.md file to quickly get up to speed.
4. Continuously update README.md, DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md, and ROADMAP.md to reflect the current project status and plans.

This process ensures that anyone can quickly understand the current state of the project and continue work efficiently.

## Deployment
(Include guidelines for deploying the application, if applicable.)

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
(Include information about the CI/CD pipeline, if applicable.)
