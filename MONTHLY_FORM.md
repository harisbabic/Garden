### Additional Measurements and Considerations

1. **Growth Stage**: Track the growth stage (seedling, vegetative, flowering, fruiting) for each plant.
2. **Pest and Disease Monitoring**: Notes on any pests or diseases observed and treatments applied.
3. **Harvest Dates**: When each crop was harvested.
4. **Yield**: Amount of produce harvested from each plant.
5. **Weather Conditions**: Notes on weather conditions that may affect plant growth (extreme heat, cold, rainfall).
6. **Soil Moisture**: Regularly check and record soil moisture levels to ensure plants are not over- or under-watered.
7. **Pruning and Maintenance**: Record any pruning, staking, or other maintenance activities.
