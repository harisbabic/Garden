## Thread Handoff Process
To maintain continuity across development sessions and conversation threads, we use a standardized handoff process:

1. At the end of each significant development session or conversation thread, update the PROJECT_STATUS.md file with the latest handoff summary.
2. The handoff summary should include:
   - Project Status Summary
   - Current Focus
   - Recent Changes
   - Next Steps
   - Open Questions or Challenges
3. At the beginning of each new development session or conversation thread, refer to the PROJECT_STATUS.md file to quickly get up to speed.
4. Continuously update README.md, DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md, and ROADMAP.md to reflect the current project status and plans.

This process ensures that anyone can quickly understand the current state of the project and continue work efficiently.
